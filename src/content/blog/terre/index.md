As I sat there, gazing at the grey nightsky
Peering at the shy dots
hiding behind the whitish clouds
And the wondorous streaks of light
never making it to earth

And as I sat there, tears streaming down my cheeks
dripping from my chin
tickling the narrow between my breasts
Reached down to my belly, the estuary

As I sat there, the nimbus started raining
as if the earth wanted to reciprocate,
console by crying out her own burdens

I sat there, contemplating the raindrops
railing through the slanted cables

I sat there face to face with earth
sharing each others’ wordless griefs

And I realised, I’m not alone.
