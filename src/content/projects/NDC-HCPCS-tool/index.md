Developed a full stack application (Django Rest Framework + Nuxtjs) called NDC-HCPCS search tool that queries and returns csv exportable search results of drug data from the given keyword/ csv, which added value to CompileIncâ€™s healthgraph tool.

Worked on ETL pipelines that updates a postgres database daily with cronjobs from frequently changing source datasets.
