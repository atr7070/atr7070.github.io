Perseids are cosmic litter left by the comet 109P/Swift tuttle in our solar system. The origin of this comet is unknown. Dr. Nick Mosqowitz says it could be from anywhere, there are reservoirs of such bodies like kuiper belts, that shoot such bodies to far systems. One such object, the icy parent of perseids was shoot into our solar system and it became a comet, with an odd eccentric orbit, littering our system. What if the comet is a way of communication between the systems. What if there are messages in these meteorites that manage to survive our atmosphere? What if .. the shower itself was a calculated geometrical message in our nightsky? Or if these fireballs carry life itself from far beyond? Or Extra terrestrial beings
